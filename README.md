# dweb guide
by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

-----

With this **guide** your will learn how to create a **dweb**, **decentralized web**, **distributed web**, **p2p web**, **content-addressable web**.

This **guide** is meant to give a software developer enough information that they could go write software for or to create what has been called:
**dweb**, **decentralized web**, **distributed web**, **p2p web**, **content-addressable web**, etc.

And, in addition to that, **this guide will guide a software developer through the process of implementing it**.

I think if you want to make a **dweb**, **decentralized web**, **distributed web**, **p2p web**, **content-addressable web**, etc be successful and become ubiquitous, it is not enough for someone (like me or anyone else) to just go out an create a bunch of software to create a **dweb**, **decentralized web**, **distributed web**, **p2p web**, **content-addressable web**, etc.
I think you need to enable all software developers to be able to do this themselves.
They need to understand it.
And they need to make their own code for it.
